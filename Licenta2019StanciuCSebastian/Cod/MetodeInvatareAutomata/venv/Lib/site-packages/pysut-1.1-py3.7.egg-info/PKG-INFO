        <b>Dependencies:</b> <br>
        numpy >= 1.9<br>
        scipy >= 0.14<br>
        
        <br>
        <b>Tutorial:</b><br>
        https://github.com/cmutel/pySUT/blob/master/Doc/pySUT_Documentation.ipynb <br>
        <b>Documenation of all methods and functions:</b><br>
        http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/stefanpauliuk/pySUT/blob/master/Doc/pysut.html
        <br>
        
        <b> Below, a quick installation guide and a link to the tutorial are provided:</b><br><br>
        
        <b>a) Installation as package:</b> <br>
        Pull package via git pull or download as .zip file and unpack. Choose a convenient location (Here: 'C:\MyPythonPackages\'). Then open a console, change to the directory ../pySUT-master/, and install the package from the command line: <br>
        > python setup.py install 
        
        This makes the package available to Python. At any other place in a system with the same python installation, pydsm is now ready to be imported simply by <br>
        > import pysut
        
        This setup also allows us to run the unit test: <br>
        
        > import unittest
        
        > import pysut
        
        > import pysut.tests
        
        > unittest.main(pysut.tests, verbosity=2)
        
        Or, to run a specific test
        
        > unittest.main(pydsm.tests.test_allocations_constructs, verbosity=2)
        
        <br>
        <b>b) Manual installation, by modifying the python path</b><br>
        Pull package via git pull or download as .zip file and unpack. Choose a convenient location (Here: 'C:\MyPythonPackages\'). Then include in your code the following lines <br>
        > import sys 
        
        > sys.path.append('C:\\MyPythonPackages\\pySUT-master\\pydsm\\') 
        
        > from pysut import SupplyUseTable
